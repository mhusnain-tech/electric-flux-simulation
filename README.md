# ⚡ Electric Flux Simulation

[**🌐 View Live Simulation**](https://mhusnain-tech.github.io/electric-flux-simulation/)

### **Semester Project**

This project is an interactive simulation created to visualize the physical concept of Electric Flux. It helps in understanding how the flow of electric field lines through a given surface changes based on different parameters.

## 🛠️ Simulation Details

> **The formula for the electric flux:** > $$\Phi = E \cdot A = E A \cos(\theta)$$

### **Interactive Parameters:**
* **Electric Field (E):** Adjust the strength of the field lines.
* **Area (A):** Change the size of the surface area.
* **Angle (θ):** Rotate the surface to see how the orientation affects the flux.

## 💻 Technical Implementation

The project is built using a standard web stack to ensure it runs smoothly in any browser without external dependencies:

* **HTML5 Canvas:** Used for real-time rendering of the field lines and the rotating surface.
* **CSS3:** Used for a clean, centered layout and a professional UI.
* **JavaScript:** Handles the trigonometric calculations and the animation frame updates.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  **Clone** the repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3.  Experiment with the **sliders** to see the flux value update live.

### **Project Status**
This is a completed semester project. Future updates might include 3D vector arrows and dynamic field line density.
